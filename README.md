## Zaurus package feed

Since July 2004, I’ve a Sharp Zaurus PDA. It runs linux, so it’s very flexible re. developing, compiling and installing your own programs. However, there are several kinds of Zauruses and several kinds of ROMs for those Zauruses. Hence, a lot of the Zaurus software available on the net didn’t work on my Zaurus with the standard Sharp ROM on it. My first Zaurus was an SL-C860, but now I have an SL-C1000.

For those programs that I didn’t get to work or just weren’t available for the Zaurus with standard ROM, I’ve set up my own feed here.

Since I’ve switched to the Cacko 1.23 ROM, I’ve made a special feed for that ROM as well in the `cacko` folder.
